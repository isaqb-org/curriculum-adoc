Architects and development teams need to effectively and efficiently communicate and document their architecture. This module provides the methodical and practical foundation.

== How to contribute or participate
Create an issue, a merge- or pull-request.



== How to build the documents

Prerequisite: You need a Java Runtime(tm) installed.

You build the output documents with `gradle`.

That will produce both pdf and html output in German (DE) _and_ English (EN),
unless you modify the configuration.

In case you want to change that, adjust the following part of `build.gradle`:

[source,groovy]
----
task buildDocs {
  group 'Documentation'
  description 'Grouping task for generating all languages in several formats'
  dependsOn "renderNoRemarksDE", "renderNoRemarksEN", "renderWithRemarksDE", "renderWithRemarksEN"
}
----



== Maintainers

This repository is currently maintained by Gernot Starke.

It was forked from https://github.com/isaqb-org/advanced-template,
so the contributors of that project basically contributed to this one, too.
Thanx, Benjamin Wolff (@Programming-Wolf) for providing such a useful template
