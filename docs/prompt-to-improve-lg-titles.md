# Prompt to check/improve LG titles



## Introduction

Some LG titles don't satisfy the current criteria for "appropriate learning goal titles".
(given in the adoc files 02-learning-goals.adoc in the section directories)

A short guideline could be:

### Start with an active verb
Use verbs that reflect observable outcomes — e.g. analyze, design, evaluate, apply, document, compare, implement, justify.

### Avoid vague verbs like understand, know, learn, be familiar with.

### Focus on capability, not content
Titles describe what the learner can do after completing the unit, not what the instructor covers.

✅ “Evaluate software architectures using defined quality criteria”
❌ “Software architecture evaluation”

### Keep them short and specific
6–10 words is usually sufficient.
One clear competence per goal — avoid combining multiple abilities.

### Use consistent grammatical form
Example pattern:
Verb + object/context + purpose/criteria (optional)
e.g. “Design APIs that meet usability and maintainability criteria.”
