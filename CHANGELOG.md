# Release Notes

## New in 2025.1

The newer ADOC curriculum (2025.1) expands scope and specificity: 
* it adds GenAI usage, Docs-as-Code, more notation options (C4, ArchiMate, canvases), 
* it adds explicit view definitions, and 
* it updates standards from IEEE 1471 to ISO/IEC 42010:2022. 
* It also refactors timing guidance by splitting teaching vs. exercise minutes while keeping the total duration at 12 hours.

### Detailed overview of Changes

| LG  | 2021 text (essence) | 2025 text (essence) | What changed   |
| --- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------| 
| 1-4 | “Know typical notation…” (UML, BPMN, ER, EPC).    | “**Choose** appropriate notations…” adds **C4**, **ArchiMate**, and **canvases** (ACC, DDD Canvas). | Scope broadened); introduces additional, modern notations and canvases.   |
| 1-5 | “Know variants of processes and their influence.” | “**Adapt** documentation efforts to different processes.”   | Stronger competency (from “know” → “adapt”); emphasis on tailoring work.  |
| 2-3  | “Determine appropriate structure…” | “**Define** a suitable structure…” | Minor verb upgrade; intent unchanged.  |
| **2-5 (new)**               | — | **GenAI application scenarios** for documentation (generate from code, compare to code, extract from unstructured sources, etc.). | **New topic**: where GenAI adds value in doc work.  |
| **2-6 (renumbered/updated)** | Templates: arc42, C4, **IEEE 1471**. | Templates: arc42, C4, **ISO/IEC 42010:2022** (modern standard). | Templates moved 2-5→**2-6** and standard updated from IEEE 1471 to ISO/IEC 42010.   |
| 3-3 | “Document architectural views” (generic guidance). | “Apply different views…” **explicitly lists** Building Block, Runtime, Deployment. | Makes views **explicit/mandatory** (clearer competency targets).   |
| 4-2           | “**Know** requirements for tools and artifacts.” | “**Define** requirements for tools and artifacts.” | Higher bar: from awareness to definition. |
| **4-3 (new)** | —                                                | **Docs-as-Code** (Markdown/AsciiDoc, text-to-diagram tools like PlantUML).   | **New topic**: docs-as-code practices and generators.  |
| **4-4 (new)** | —                                                | **Apply GenAI tools** (opportunities/risks, targeted use, validate results). | **New topic**: hands-on GenAI use in doc workflows.    |
| 5-1 | “**Recognize the need** to check fitness for purpose.”      | “**Ensure documentation is fit for purpose**” (ties to LG 1-2). | Emphasis from recognition → **assurance**; cross-ref to stakeholders.   |
| 6-1 | “**Know** practical examples of architecture documentation.” | “**Explain pros and cons** of sample architecture documentation.” | Higher bar: from knowing to analyzing/arguing.   |
